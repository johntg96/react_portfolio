                I am interested in computers and networking as a whole with subsets of knowledge (some deeper than others) in various areas.
                I am a general computer hobbyist with interests in fields of website development, OS administration, and game development (my next project).
                Some of my self-taught knowledge came from applying free learning resources to improve efficiency (even slightly) while I was on the job.
                <ul>
                  <br/>
                  <li>YMCA</li>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Position: Maintenance Associate</li>
                      <li>At the YMCA I was involved with general building maintenance. One of my duties was to check the pool and hot-tub water balance to see whether chemicals needed to be added to the water.
                        The calculations are simple, yet time-consuming enough that I built a simple UI to perform the calculations with JavaScript. This was one of my <em>first</em> web development applications <em style={{ fontSize: "80%" }}>(waterCalc)</em>.
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                    <br/>
                    <li>Trafera</li>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Position: Computer Repair Technician III</li>
                      <li>I was given the task of resolving data inconsitency/misalignment with hardware components and service repair order devices awaiting repair in hold bins.
                        I worked alongside the OEM receiving/shipping department and the OEM submission team to collect data and resolve errors such as:
                        <ul style={{ fontSize: '0.8em', fontFamily: 'monospace' }}>
                          <br/>
                          <li>OEM/internal parts being placed in the wrong warranty category</li>
                          <li>Devices being placed in the wrong warranty category</li>
                          <li>Parts being matched with the wrong devices</li>
                          <li>Parts + Devices being located in the wrong hold bin</li>
                          <li>Missing parts and/or devices</li>
                          <li>Mismatches between parts and devices</li>
                          <br/>
                        </ul>
                        After awhile I began to automate my Excel spreadsheets with Visual Basic. The data became larger and larger, yet the process to resolve these issues stayed the same.
                        I felt this was a great learning opportunity, so I then created a web application for myself to help speed up efficiency in the logging process.
                        This became a <em>deeper introduction</em> into web development for me <em style={{ fontSize: "80%" }}>(h0ldb1nz)</em>.
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                <img src='images/me_cats_plant_art_fresh-shadow.webp' className='me-cats-art-with-shadows'/>
                <img src='images/me_cats_plant_art_fresh.webp' className='me-cats-art-without-shadows'/>
                My background was in computer hardware repair, but I gradually shifted towards software. I'm dedicated to enhancing my skills to consistently improve the quality of my work.
